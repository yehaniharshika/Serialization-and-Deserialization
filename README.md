<b>Serialization And Deserialization In Java</b>

Introduction

Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream, allowing the object to be easily saved to a file, transmitted over a network, or stored in memory. 
Deserialization is the reverse process, converting the byte stream back into a copy of the original object. These processes are fundamental in Java for enabling object persistence and data interchange.
